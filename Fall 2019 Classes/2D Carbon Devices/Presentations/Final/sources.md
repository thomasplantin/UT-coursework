Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have a high capacity but usually suffer
from a low charge/discharge rate compared with another important
electrochemical storage device, supercapacitors.

Using nano-sized materials to prepare electrodes is one of the
most promising routes toward flexible batteries.

To build a flexible LIB with a high capacity and
fast charge and discharge rates, we integrated highly conductive,
porous, and flexible GF with LTO and LFP as anode and cathode, respectively (Fig. 1).
